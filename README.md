##P2 Submission - XKCD Comic Password Generator

##This project is part of the "CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Applications" Fall semester class.
  The goal was to create a web application similar to the Password Generator outlined in 
  the XKCD comic found here https://xkcd.com/936/ .  The application can create a password 
  using a series of words (user specifies how many), with options for a number and special
  character as well.
